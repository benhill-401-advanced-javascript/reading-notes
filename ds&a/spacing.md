# Space Complexity

How much memory is taken up as the input increases?

Auxiliary space complexity refers to the space required by the algorithm, not including space taken up by the inputs. 
- Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
- Strings require O(n) space where n is the string length
- Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (arrays) or the number of keys (objects)
