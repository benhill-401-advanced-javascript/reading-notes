# Event Driven Applications

1. _Why is access control important?_

- It's important because security. Or do you want everyone to steal your stuff?

2. _Describe an application that would need access control._

- Any app that that stores a username and password would need one

3. _What is a role used for?_

- A role is used to determine what data a user or client can access

4. _Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?_

- I'd say it's more scalable in that the role itself is given access authority so many different users can be assigned that role and access level
