### What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".
Components are used to tell React what we want to see on the screen.

- Components takes in parameters called props and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.
- The **render** method returns a _description_ of what you want to see on the screen by returning a React element using JSX.
- The `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div').
- You can put any JS expressions within braces inside JSX

**_Component types:_**

- _React.Component_
