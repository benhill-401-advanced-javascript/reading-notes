# [Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

1. _Linked List_ - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
1. _Singly_ - Singly refers to the number of references the nodes has. A singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points fo the Next node in a linked list.
1. _Doubly_ - Refers to there being two references within the node. A doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the next and previous node.
1. _Node_ - Individual items/links that live in a linked list. each node contains the data for each link.
1. _next_ - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
1. _head_ - is a reference type of node to the first node in a linked list.
1. _current_ - is a reference type of type node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linkedl list.

- When traversing a linked list, you are not able to us a foreach or for loop.
- best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. Allowing us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. A NullReferenceException gets thrown and our program will crash/end.

- Regardless of the language we start to program in, one of the first things that we encounter are data structures.
- _data structures_ - A way we can organize our data, variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structes.
