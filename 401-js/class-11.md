- _Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms):_

  - A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance to be creatd and gives access to that created instance. it contains statis variables that can accomodate unique and private instances of itself.

- _Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes:_

  - A singleton represents a single instance of an object. Only one can be created, no matter how many times the object is instantiated. If there’s already an instance, the singleton will create a new one.
  - In the article below, the author shows a problem that is created where he created multiple instances of the Logger Class and got a problem in their console as a result. The author adds a class called Singleton class which carries a getInstance() method which allows us to instantiate one logger and then using the getInstance() method we can return that logger to any file that wants to use it.
  - He also noted that he needed to add the getInstance() method everywhere he had created a new instance of his Logger class. Which returns all of his instances in the CLI so he went back into logger and changed it to a single class.
