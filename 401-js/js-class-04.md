# Advanced Mongo/Mongoose

1. **Why would a developer choose to make data models?**
   Models promote consensus among developers, customers and other stakeholders. A data model also promotes agreement on vocabulary and jargon. The model highlights the chosen terms so they can be driven forward into software artifacts. The resulting software becomes easier to maintain and extend.

1. **What purpose do CRUD operations serve?**
   Create, read (retrieve), update, and delete are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used.

1. **What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?**
   Postgres is an open source object-relational database.
   Mongo is a cross-platform document-oriented database

1. **What is Mongoose and why do we need it?**
   Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful.
