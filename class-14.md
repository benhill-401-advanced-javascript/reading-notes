# Read: 14b - What Google Learned About Teams

## Article from NY Times

As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. 
In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that **groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.** 
- People working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 
- If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work **together.**

Google spent roughly 10 years and millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees' lives. Hundreds of people were selected to participate in a group study where they were broken down into teams and each team was given a multitude of tasks to complete.
- Researchers found that if a group failed or performed poorly on one task, they typically failed or performed poorly for every task.
- Teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. 
- Researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished "good" teams from dysfunctional teams was how teammates treated one another. 
- The right norms in a group could raise the group's collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright. 
- Researchers found they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:
  1. **Members spoke in roughly the same proportion**. Each team did so in different ways, but at the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. 
  2. **The good teams all had high average social sensitivity**. Meaning they all paid attention how others felt based on their tone of voice, expressions, and body language. 
- As it turns out, when you care about the members of your team and ask after them or engage in regular conversations about life, listen to them, let them talk, team members feel respected which propogates healthy environments and trust. When an individual feels safe around the people they're working with, focus will increase. I wonder how many degrees it took to come to this conclusion? 

The paradox is that Google's intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show empathy to feelings and needs. 
It wasn't a complete waste of time as now there is predictive indexes in most companies to give them useful data on common traits of an individual, which helps place that person into the team who works well with a particular group.
