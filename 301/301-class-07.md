Brush up on this article you read in 201: [What Google Learned From its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

[A conversation about REST](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser: HTTP. (hypertext transfer protocol)
- All of the world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST" which provides a definition of a resource, which is what those things point to.
- A webpage is a representation of a resource or URL (uniform resource locator).
- Other examples of resources are "web services" or "APIs" whose concept is that machines could use the web just like people do. Meaning machines can use the same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other. 

The entire "article" never even gave a meaning of what the acronym REST meant so I went and found it lol:
**Representational State Transfer**

## API Keys

Make sure to save your API Keys in a safe place as they give permissions to make changes to your site. They're literally a password for your API.
