## [EJS Partials](https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433)

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
Partials can be thought of like functions, breaking down into chunks the code you have to make up the whole page. 

For example, if we have a navbar in our EJS, we can have a file specifically for that called "navbar.ejs" which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home and post pages. 
- Once the partials are created we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates. 
- Any JS or non-html syntax I include in my templates need to be wrapped by ```<%%>```
