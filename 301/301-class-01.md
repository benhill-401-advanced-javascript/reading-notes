# Read: 01 - SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Shay Howe's intro to RWD

Resonsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Its focus is around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. 
Responsive means to react quickly and positively to any change, continually and fluidly changing based on different factors, such as viewport width. 
The most popular technique lies with responsive web design, favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way. This solution has the benefits of being all three; responsive, adaptive, and mobile.

There are quite a few different techniques with responsive web design which can e be found [here](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/), but I'm just going to briefly describe one. **mobile first**.

- The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows. 
- The operating belief behind mobile first is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldn't have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them over writen with mobile styles later.
- The mobile first approach also advocates designing with the constraints of a mobile user in mind. Before too long, the majority of the internet consumption will be done on a mobile device.

## [All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)

Float is a CSS positionin property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed, or "text wrap." 
In page layout programs, the boxes that hold the text can be told to honor the text wrap, or to ignore it. Ignoring text wrap will allow the words to flow right over the image like it wasn't even there. 

**Floats are used for** creating entire web layouts (although devs typically use Flexbox and Grid rather than floats for layout these days).
Floats are most helpful in smaller instances like block elements in order to have a neat layout in various places.

Floats sister property is **clear**. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. 
For example. 
Imagine you have three boxes laid out on your page, main, sidebar, and footer. If you don't use clear, your footer will display to the right of your main and under your sidebar. Which would look dumb.
Clear places that footer right where its name says it should be, smack on the bottom.
