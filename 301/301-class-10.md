# The Call Stack and Debugging

## [Call Stack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

The call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like JS interpreter in browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions - what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. 

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

At the most basic level, a [call stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/) is a data structure that uses Last In, First Out
