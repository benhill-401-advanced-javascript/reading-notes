# Read: 15 - Diversity and Inclusion

## Silicon Valley's gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago (2017)

Between 1983 and 85, the game market shrank from $3.2 billion to $100 million. "the crash was primariy brought about by low-quality games flooding the market, which smothered consumer confidence." 
This sounds to me as if the quality of games is what's important. The article goes on to say that advertisers sold games to boys because they were the ones buying them and the reason they were buying them was because advertisers targeted them. 
This sounds like boys are actually the victim of advertisers. Just to make a buck. 
This article makes it seem as if boys only like games because advertisers targeted marketing, not the quality of the games. Which is obviously the other way around, due to the data that was presented in the article in ONE PARAGRAPH.
Does it sound like a wise marketing tactic to target a demographic that doesn't appear to have any interest in your product? 
Do make-up marketers target boys? Obviously not, because they're not interested. Likewise for girls. The gaming advertisers wouldn't waste their time targeting them because their data didn't tell them they were interested. That would be a **waste of money**. 
This article is terrible. It's blaming girls for not having as much interest in games and building a narrative that because of that, they're not welcome in a tech career that is "dominated by men." Likewise it is trying to make men feel bad for being domineering. Speaking about the single acts of what a man did wrong and making it seem as if it's because of some "male culture aimed to exclude women." 
Advertisers and data analytics build their career on data that is already there and pulling from it. Complaining about the data they find doesn't change anything. 

### Why diversity matters to your tech company (2015)

This article just complains more about tech companies having a majority of white males employed. 
Is the aim of these people to force other demographics to work in tech? Cause it looks to me as if the majority of people who don't work at a tech company is the lack of interest.
