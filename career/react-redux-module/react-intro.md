# Intro to React

React is used as a replacement to jQuery 

React can be used in most applications that have any sort of visual view

- Is separated into components that handles the feature
- You can write components yourself using javascript or you can find components written by others and download them 

Data flow is built via components which makes re-rendering highly effecient 

React has a "virtual DOM" which is just a JS object that monitors the current state of the object
