## [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

In cryptography, the Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
- For example:
  - with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would be B, etc. 

- Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

Named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. 

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenere cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers no communications security. 

**Key** - In cryptography, a key is a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm.
