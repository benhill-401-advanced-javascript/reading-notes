[What is Linear Regression?](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/)
- Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.
  - The overall idea of regression is to examine two things
  1. does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent)
  2. which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do theyimpact the outcome variable?
- Use cases
  - The regression might be used to idenfity the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable 
    - relationship between sales and marketing spending, age and income
  - Second, to forecast effects or impact of changes
  - Third, regression analysis predicts trends and future values
    - "what will the price of gold be in 6 months?"

You can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model, and sckit learn

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains functions for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
