# [List Comprehensions](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python)

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
- Consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.
- The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists

To help you remember that your syntax is a list comprehension, the expression is wrapped in square brackets
- Example:
- `[ expression for item in list if conditional ]` 

is equivalent to:
```
  for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression
```
