## Charts

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables. They're easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they're not always easy to create. 
- A good way to get started with just is to use a JavaScript plugin, Chart.js. 
- It's a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar, line, and pie charts incredibly easy. 
- First you have to download the latest version of Chart.js (done) and copy the code into the directory you'll be working in.
