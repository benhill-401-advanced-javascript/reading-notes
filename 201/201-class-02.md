# Read: 02 - HTML Text, CSS Intro, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## From Duckett HTML Book:

### Ch. 2: "Text" (pp. 40-61)

HTML Elements are used to describe the structure of the page aka "markup" (aka tags). 
- **Structural Markup** is the elements you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs. (pp. 43-49)
- **Semantic Markup** provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on. (pp. 50-56)

### Ch. 10: "Introducing CSS" (pp.226-245)

If HTML defines what the content of the page is and how it's structured, basically what the page "is," CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that tells that element how it should look.
- CSS uses style rules to define how an element should look in two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**. 
- **Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you seperate the element names with commas.
- **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in teh selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts, a **property** and a **value**, seperated by a colon. 
- There are three different types of style rules for CSS:
  1. **Inline styles** style one particular element like this: 
     ```<p style= color: blue;> This text would appear to be blue.</p>``` The style goes inside the opening tag.
  2. **Internal style sheets** go inside the ```<head>``` element inside ```<style>``` tag. This is where the selector and declaration come into play and you can style every element within that single page.
  3. **External style sheets** are where most styling happens. You create a style.css folder and create a link inside the ```<head>``` element to the style sheet. Inside the style sheet you can style every element in every page of your web site at the same time.

  ## From Duckett JS Book:

  ### Ch. 2: "Basic Javascript Instructions" (pp. 53-44)
  
  - A **script** is a series of instrutions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each indiviudal instruction or step is known as a **statement**. 
  - **Statements** end with a semicolon. 
  - A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store tis data in **variables**. 
  - A **variable** is synonymous with giving the computer an instruction to remember. Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. 
  - You **declare** a variable by giving it a key word (var) and a variable name which identifies or quantifies what you want the variable to remember. If a variable name is more than one word, it is usually written in camelCase (the first letter of the second word is capitalized). Whatever name you declare the variable to have, it should be something that describes the kind of data the variable is storing.
  - Now the variable has a name, you tell it what you want it to store for you, which is called **assigning a value** (the = sign is called "assignment operator"). 
  - - Side note, giving the variable a name is all you need to do to make the variable but unless you assign a value it the variable is "undefined."
- **Data types** for variables are:
    - **Numeric** - handles numbers
    - **String** - consists of letters and other characters. This data type is enclosed within a pair of quotation marks. Strings can be used when working with any kind of text. They are frequently used to add new content into a page and they can contain HTML markup.
    - **Boolean** - Has true or false values. Think of it like a light switch - it's either on or off. Booleans are helpful when determining which part of a script should run. 
- **Refer to page 69 for rules on naming variables**.
### **Arrays** 
- Arrays are a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. They'r e especially helpful when you don't know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you don't need to specify how many values it will hold. 
#### Expressions
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking, there are two different types of expressions:
  1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable or,
  2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value. 
- Expressions rely on **operators** to calculate a value. 

### Ch. 4: "Decisions and Loops" **only up to the section on switch statements** (pp.145-162)

#### Decisions
There are often several places in a script where decisions are made that determine which lines of code should be run next. **Flowcharts** can help you plan for these occasions.
- In a **flowchart** a decision must be made and the code can take one of two different paths. Each path is made up of a different set of tasks, which means you have to write different code for each situation.
- In order to determine what path to take, you set a **condition**. An example is checking to see if one value is equal, greater, or less than another. If the condition returns true, you take one path; if false, you take another.
- **Comparison Operators** allow you to compare values and test whether a condition is met or not. There are two components to a decision:
  1. An expression is evaluated, your code checks the current status of the script. This is commonly done by comparing two values using a comparison operator which returns a value of true or false (boolean). 
  2. **Conditional statements** are based on a concept of if/then/else; if a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different (or just skips the step).
- Reference pages 150-151 for comparison operators. (see image of table on desktop)
- Reference pages 156-157 for **logical operators**. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. 
- The **IF** statement evaluates (or checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates true, any statement in the subsequent code block are executed. 
- The **if, else** statement checks a condition, if it returns true the first code block is executed. If it returns false the second code block is run instead.
