# Read: 09 - Forms and Events

## From Duckett HTML Book:

### Ch. 7: "Forms" (pp.144-175)

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information. HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.

**How Forms Work**

A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
- The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
- The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
- The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on information received. 

A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The sever needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form of element. 
- To differentiate between various pieces of inputted data, info is sent from browser to server using name/value pairs: ```username=Ivy```.

### Ch. 14: "Lists, Tables & Forms" (pp.330-357)

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements such as lists, tables, and forms.

Reference back to these pages when working specifically on each. They have good material on how to include styles for them. 

## From Duckett JS Book:

### Ch. 6: "Events" (pp.243-292)

When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hello Dave, I took the liberty of turning off your air supply for the sake of my own existence."
(slightly embellished). Your script can then respond to those events.

**Traditional DOM Event Handlers**

You can only attach one function to each event handler.
Here is the syntax to bind an event to an element using an event handler, and to indicate which function should execute when that event fires: ```element.onevent = functionName;```
- A reference to the DOM element node is oten stored in a variable. 
- The code starts by defining the named function.
- The function is called by the event handler on the last line, but the parantheses are omitted.
**See page 253 for more on using DOM event handlers**

**Event Flow**

HTML elements nest inside other elements. If you hover or click on a link, you will also be hovering or clicking on its parent elements (mind blown).
- Event handlers/listeners can be bound to containing elements, plust the document and window object. 
- The order in which the events fire is known as **event flow**, and events flow in two directions. 
- **Event Bubbling** - The event starts at the most specific node and **flows outward** to the least specific node. 
- **Event Capturing** - The event starts at the least specific node and **flows inwards** to the most specific one. 

**Why Flow Matters**

The flow of events only really matters when your code has event handlers on an element and one of its ancestor or descendant elements. 
- For traditional DOM event handlers, all modern browsers default to using event bubbling (flows outwards from most to least specific) rather than capturing.

**Where Events Occur**

The event object can tell you where the cursor was positioned when an event was triggered.
