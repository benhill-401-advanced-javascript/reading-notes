# Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## From Duckett HTML Book:

### Ch. 5: "Images" (pp.94-125. See also pages 413-420 for CSS Image properties)

If you're building a site from scratch, it's good practice to create a folder for all the images the site uses. 

**Adding Images**

- To add an image use the ```<img>``` tag. This is an empty element which means it doesn't have a closing tag. it must carry the following two attributes:
1. **src** tells the browser where it can find the image file. 
1. **alt** provides a text description of the img which describes the img if you can't see it. 
1. **title** provides additional information about the img for screen readers. 
```<img src="images/quokka.jpg alt="A family of quokka" title= "The quokka is an evil Koala looking rodent which is regularly seen on Happy Tree Friends slaughtering random woodland creatures">```

**Where to Place Images in your Code**

Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement:
1. **Before a Paragraph** - ```<p>``` starts on a new line after the image.
1. **Inside the start of a paragraph** - first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image. 
1. **Middle of the paragraph** - the image is placed between the words of a paragraph.

**Image Formats**

- **JPEG**: Whenever you have many colors in a picture you should use jpeg
- **GIF**: Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large ares of the same. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colors (colors covering large areas). Note that images with snow, sky, or grass are not flat colors as they are made up of subtly different shades of the same color.

**Dimensions**

Images you use on your site should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page. 
What this means is get the picture to the size you want it in your file where the image is located. Don't put a 3000x13349587 sized picture in your image file and try and shrink and stretch it using width/height in the code. Makes stuff look all funky.

**Transparency**

Creating an image that is partialy transparent for the web involves selecting one of two formats:
- **Transparent GIF** - If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and is 100% transparent, you can save the image as a GIF.
- **PNG** If the transparent part of the image has a diagonal 

### Ch. 11: "Color" (pp. 246-263)

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want. you can use a color picker. 

- VScode has a hexadiagram built in when using the color property where you can choose any color you like. 

### Ch. 12: "Text" (pp. 264-299)

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing. 
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typfaces there are several options. but you need to have the right license to use them. 
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented. 
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on tet, or when they have visited a link.
