# Read: 08 - More CSS Layout

## From Duckett HTML book: 

### Ch 15: "Layout" ...one more again

**Screen Sizes**
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens. 

**Screen Resolution**
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch (pixels). Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allows users to adjust the resolution of their screens. 

**Page Sizes**
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens. This is about 3-5 inches and is the size of an iPhone 4.

**Fixed Width Layouts**
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels. 

**Liquid Layouts**
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

**Layout Grids**
Composition in any visual art is the placement or arrangement of visual elements - how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true of web designers. 

**Multiple Style Sheets**
Some web page authors split up their CSS style rules into seperate sheets. For example they might use one sheet to control the layout of another to control fonts, one for colors etc. 
Some authors use a different style sheet to control different types of objects being styled: layout, forms, tables, or sub sections.
There are two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:
1. Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that stylesheet can use the @import rule to import other style sheets. 
2. In HTML page you can use a seperate ```<link>``` element for each style sheet. (preferred)

**CSS Frameworks**
CSS Frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layoud grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing from scratch.
