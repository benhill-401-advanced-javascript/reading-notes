## [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

This article breaks down do's and dont's of what to do in interviews.
One of the most common mistakes in an interview when given a programming problem to solve is to dive in asap.
Make sure you take enough time to understand the problem compeltely before attempting to solve it.
Keep it simple

**Simple Steps**

1. Read the problem completely, twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments.
1. Replace the comments with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

**As much as 70% of the time should be spent in steps 1-3**

As much sense as this makes to me, article aside, I've had folks in partner power hour explicitly say they don't like it when interviewees spend more time on the problem domain than they do writing code. A good first question to ask, then, once presented with a problem, is to ask whoever is interviewing you what their preference is.

**Do they want me to dive into code ASAP or may I press for more information so I can work out the problem domain and have better success at solving the problem??**

The premise of this article is labelling being busy as a form of weakness. You're not managing your time well if you're busy.
It gives a wide range of implications and quotes a lot of people who must have done quite a bit of being busy to get where they are so they can afford to manage their time with less stress.
How does a doctor become a doctor? Hours and hours of training, every day.
Busyness depends on the context of what you're trying to do as a career. You don't hold the luxurious prerogative of setting your own schedule to "teach people around you not to take advantage of your time." Quite the opposite. If we're learning under someone, we would be taking advantage of their valuable time if we set a limit on what they allow them to teach us.
This article is garbage sauce.

Totally get it though. Don't kill yourself to achieve your goals, but you better wake up and smell the coffee cause you're going to be tired if you're going to be doing something worthwhile. Especially if you're worth \$1k an hour.
Furthermore. You could be doing something you absolutely love. Therefore, if you put in extra hours into the night, it's a stress and exhaustion because you don't want to do anything else with your time.
This is not weakness. This is strength.

We don't get to live in this fantasy land where we "imagine" we're worth more than we are without going through the work to get ourselves there.

## [How to think like a programmer - lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

The best way to problem solve (like a programmer) involves have a framework and practicing it.

### Understand

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don't understand them.

This is why working out your problem domain is so important, so you take the time to understand as best you can what it is you want to do.

### Plan

When everyone is saying the same thing about not diving straight into writing code, it's probably a thing. Plan out your approach and annotate your plan with comments, changing your logic into code once the plan starts to come together.

### Divide

Don't try and solve it all at once. Break out your project/problem into bite size chunks that you can destroy piece by piece until you've repelled the forces of darkness and have defeated the Nazi's.

### Stuck?

Check this out bro. You're gonna get stuck. You're going to get bugs. This is all a part of being a dev.
Stuff that you think should work often times will not work.
Your job is to redefine your expectations to fit into the reality that you should be curious about how to figure out how to squash a bug. Let it thrill you when you get some errors.

So you have a problem. Good. Now. Ask why it's a problem. Good. Now ask why 4 more times. You should get a different answer to each why. Now deploy your counter-measure, keep calm and return fire.
