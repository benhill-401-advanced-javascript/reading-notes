# Reading Assignment 10

## From Duckett JS Book:

### Ch. 10: "Error Handling & Debugging" (pp.450-486)

Javascript can be hard to learn and everyone makes mistakes when writing it. This chapter will help you learn how to find the errors in your code. It will also teach you how to write scripts that detail with potential errors gracefully. 

**To find the source of an error**, it helps to know how scripts are processed. The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run. 
**The Javascript interpreter uses the concept of execution contexts**. There is one global execution context; plus, each function creates a new execution context. 

#### The Stack

The Javascript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks (or piles) the new function on top of the current task. 
- Once the new task has been performed, the interpreter can go back to the task in hand. 
- Each time a new item is added to the stack, it creates a new execution context.
- Variables defined in a function (execution context) are only available in that function (local). If a function is called a second time, the variables can have different values. 

**Understanding Errors**
If a JS statement generates an error, then it throws an **exception**. At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code. Anticipating errors caused by users help with coding an exception like if/else or for/while loops. 

**Error Objects**
Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them. 
- There are seven types of built-in error objects in JS. 
1. **Error** - Generic error, other errors are all based upon this error.
1. **SyntaxError** - Syntax has not been followed.
1. **ReferenceError** - Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope.
1. **TypeError** - An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced.
1. **RangeError** - numbers not in acceptable range.
1. **URIError** - encodeURI(), decodeURI(), and similar methods used incorrectly.
1. **EvalError** - eval() function used incorrectly.
(refer to pages 460-461 for more on these error objects)

**A Debugging Workflow**
Debugging is about deduction: eliminating potential causes of an error. Try to narrow down where the problem might be, then look for clues.
