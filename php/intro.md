# Introduction

What is PHP?

PHP runs on the server side, sends data to client side. 

PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor: a widely used, general-purpose scripting language

In order to write PHP you'll need a _host_ to serve web pages

## Local

- XAMPP
- MAMP

In a PHP document, in order to write code you need to write `<?php`. 

If I were to write a `Hello World!` program, it would look like this:

```
<?php 

echo "Hello, World!";
```

Php doesn't need a closing angle bracket. 
- Every line needs to be terminated with a semi-colon
